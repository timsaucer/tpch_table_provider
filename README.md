# TCP-H Table Providers

This repository exists as a demonstration of how to implement table providers
at a few different levels of specificity and the advantages you can gain as
compared to some of the more generic providers in the core DataFusion repository.

## Run comparisons

There are a few files in `tpch_comparisons/examples` that are designed to measure
the performance of certain queries against the different table providers.
